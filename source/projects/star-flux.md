## KIC-8462852 Star FLux Analysis

This project aims to analyze the brightness of a star named KIC-8462852 in the constellation of Cygnus. We determine wether there is a significant decrease or increase of flux for star KIC-8462852. The dataset was obtained after recording the relative flux of the star as measured from FFI (full frame image) data collected from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). 53 FFI images were downloaded from this source, and the normalized flux was calculated and reported in the dataset for this project based on BJD (Barycentric Julian Date) times.
